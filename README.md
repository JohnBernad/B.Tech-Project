# Btech Main Project
 Airline Data Analysis and Prediction System
This project involves web scraping flight data from Google Flights to train an incremental LSTM model for predicting future airfare prices. 

• It aims to provide users with accurate price predictions for specific routes and travel dates, helping them make informed travel budgeting decisions.  

• The project includes visualizing historical price trends to identify optimal booking times. 

• By implementing daily web scraping and incremental learning, the project ensures the model continuously updates and improves its predictions based on the latest data. Thus, 
  this model adapts to changing market conditions and airline pricing strategies, offering up-to-date insights for users.
